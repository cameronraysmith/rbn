Here we determine the relationship between network hierarchy, a topological property, and the probability of \emph{robustness} or \emph{structural stability}, a dynamical property \cite{Smale1967}. Robustness is of interest at all scales of the biological hierarchy, and has been previously studied in the context of gene-regulatory networks \cite{WADDINGTON1942a,VanNimwegen1999,Siegal2002,Ciliberti2007b,Ciliberti2007,Wagner2013}. Intuitively, robustness is the probability of stability to perturbation in the system structure for systems which have already been determined to be stable in the sense of linear stability analysis. We precisely compute the probability of stability as a distribution over system connectivity for all systems containing two or three interacting components. We find that stability to structural perturbations of this class of dynamical systems is correlated with connectivity, number of cycles, and the number of links between strongly connected components of the underlying interdependency graph. The latter derives from the fact that the permutation of strongly connected components is a symmetry of system robustness.
