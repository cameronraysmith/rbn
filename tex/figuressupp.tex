\caption{{\bf Vector fields resulting from the random sampling of two component systems.} System parameters of \ref{eq:arbitraryjacobianreactionnetwork} are rescaled to ensure the fixed point is located at $(1,1)$. The color of the dot located at the fixed point indicates whether it is stable (black) or unstable (gray).}

\caption{{\bf Example symmetries of robustness.} In this example, the connected component sizes are fixed at $\{2,1,1\}$ with a total of $3$ links between them. Red arrows correspond to transformations like \reffighiertransformations a where SCCs are swapped whereas purple arrows correspond to transformations like \reffighiertransformations b where links are moved between nodes within a SCC. (A) shows all underlying graphs while (B) shows the number of nodes in each SCC and the number of links between the SCCs.}

\caption{{\bf System stability as a function of connectivity.} The probability of stability is plotted versus connectivity for all three component systems. We note that, in contrast to robustness, the stability ranges over less than 10\% of the possible dynamic range and demonstrates no obvious significant correlation with connectivity. The red points represent the average of system stability at each connectivity.}
