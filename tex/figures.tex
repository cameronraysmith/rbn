\caption{{\bf Dynamical models in systems biology.} The top row represents a chemical reaction network (CRN) \cite{Shinar2010}, a gene regulatory network (GRN) \cite{Karlebach2008}, and an ecological regulatory network (ERN) \cite{Rohr2014} in terms of the graphical methods specific to each field mapped into the interaction graph, which provides a unified representation for networks across these fields. The second row represents a particular example of a system of differential equations that are used to model a biological network within each of the domains of application considered here \cite{Shinar2010,Karlebach2008,Shinar2010}. The third row shows the general form of a system of differential equations that can be used to model any network architecture of any size within each of the three domains of application exemplified here.}

\caption{{\bf Open systems, strongly connected components and symmetries of robustness.} (A) Example of the combination of open system modules to construct closed systems. (B) strongly connected components highlighted in gray for each of the four graphs representing the interdependencies relevant to four different three component systems. The most hierarchical system in the top panel has the highest possible number of connected components, three, whereas the system in the bottom panel containing a single cycle and therefore posessing no hierarchy contains only one connected component. The two panels in the middle represent examples of hierarchical modular systems that posess both modularity and hierarchy. (C) Symmetries of the $\hier$ transformation between graphs and SCCs. The transformation a represents an interchange of SCCs, b moving a link between nodes in a component and c adding a link. All three transformations represent symmetries of the $\hier$ transformation from graphs to SCCs while only a and b are symmetries of robustness.}
