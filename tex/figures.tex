The second row represents a particular example of a system of differential equations that are used to model a biological network within each of the domains of application considered here. The third row shows the general form of a system of differential equations that can be used to model any network architecture within each domain.}

% \caption{{\bf Open systems, strongly connected components and symmetries of robustness.} (A) Example of the combination of open system modules to construct closed systems. (B) SCCs highlighted in gray for each of the four graphs representing the interdependencies relevant to four different three variable systems. The most hierarchical network, top panel, is the one that maximizes the number of SCCs and the number of links between them. We therefore define hierarchy as $max(\hbox{ED}) - \hbox{ED}$ where ED is the edit distance representing the number of link addition/deletion operations necessary to transform a given graph into the most hierarchical one. The two panels in the middle represent examples of hierarchical modular systems that posess both modularity (i.e. SCCs with more than one variable) and hierarchy. (C) Symmetries of the $\hier$ transformation between graphs and SCCs. The transformation $a$ represents an interchange of SCCs, $b$ moving a link between nodes in a component and $c$ adding a link. All three transformations represent symmetries of the $\hier$ transformation from graphs to SCCs while only $a$ and $b$ are symmetries of robustness.}

Note that the most hierarchical system in (A) has the highest possible number of connected components, three, whereas the system containing a single cycle and therefore posessing no hierarchy contains only one connected component.

Other network architectures are shown in \ref{tab:structstabmat3}. (B) Robustness versus hierarchy. Correlation coefficient $r=0.67$.
